The letter will be mainly based on: How did we go about collaborative modelling // How did we determine what models were successful and what models were failures (along with examples of both) // the final best model along with all the relevant data // positives and negatives of collaborative modelling // and finally feedback from you guys are to whether you see a future for collaborative modeling.
